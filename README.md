# Horiseon-Code-Refactor

## Goal
The main goal of this project was to take Horiseon's existing code and refactor it to make the existing site more accessible.

## Why this project was built
The project was made to make Horiseon's site more accessible to tools like screen readers, as well as consolidate and organize the CSS selectors and properties to follow semantic structure.

## What this project solves
This projects solves the issue of visiting the Horiseon website and being unable to use any accessibility tools on it. 

## What I learned
I learned how to properly review HTML and CSS code as well as consolidate CSS code to make it take up less space in the file.

## What makes my project stand out
My project is unique in that the website retains the exact same appearance with the refactored code as it did starting out. I also commented when a CSS selector(s) would begin above every CSS selector in the style sheet, to make it as readable as possible for other programmers and developers to find when a selector begin.
